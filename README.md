# 🌏 Automatarium

> A place for automata

Automatarium is a modern take on the useful [JFLAP](https://www.jflap.org/), but designed with a modern user interface and quality-of-life features that were lacking in JFLAP. Currently Automatarium supports finite automata, with room to add additional functionality such as push-down automata and Turing machines in the future.

## Project Structure

Automatarium is a React project with a Node JS backend (that connects to a MongoDB database). We have two packages for automata simulation and jflap to automatarium file conversion.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies (don't have yarn? run `npm i -g yarn`)
3. Optionally, set up environment variables in a `.env` file in the backend to connect to a database
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the dev server at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)

There are also other yarn commands, for example you can run `yarn dev:frontend` to start the frontend without the backend (useful to test functionality without connecting a database). See `package.json` for all available commands.

## Development

This project is set up using yarn workspaces. To install a new dependency, run `yarn workspace <folder> add <package>`, where `folder` is frontend, backend, @automatarium/simulation, or @automatarium/jflap-translator, and `package` is the package you wish to add.

## Deployment

1. Ensure dependencies are installed by running `yarn`
2. Run `yarn build` to build the packages, backend and frontend
